cat("Hello, aliens. I hope that this message finds you well. I am from Earth, a nice little planet that a few billion people call home. It's not a perfect place, but we will love it. There are all sorts of beautiful things here. The ocean, the mountains, and the amazing skyscrapers that we've created come to mind, but if prompted, I could easily give at least 100 more examples. I wonder if you guys like your planet as much as we like ours. Is it temperate? Do you get along with the other inhabitants? Or is your planet no more, forcing you to wander space until you find a new planet, like the one you must have just stumbled upon? Whatever your purpose out here in space, I genuinely hope that you have a safe journey. Perhaps someone like me can have the chance to meet someone like you in the future. All the best, signing off now.")
